# AutoResume

This is the repository of my Open Source Project.
I would like to create a program that can help me and others to build a resume fast and get past checks from Robots and HR.

## Why

Company have programs build to skim who is good for a job, build every time a new resume to apply a new company or job take more time and effort than create a program that cannot only help myself but help other people that are in search of a job.

## Done
- Show Stats from the Resume and the Job Post
- Remove Specific words with the file Exceptions

## Road map
- Stats: add a Combobox to give the choice how many words occurrences to show.
- Add Save and Open file to import or export personal data.
- Exceptions: add or delete exceptions from the AutoResume app.
- Add, modify or delete Hard Skills
- Add, modify or delete Soft Skills

Thank you.
